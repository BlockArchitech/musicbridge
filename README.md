## Reasoning

Now I had multiple reasons for this, but it boiled down to one [thing](https://renewedvision.com/propresenter/). Pro7.

## How to use

1: **Set up the IAC driver on your machine.**

2: In whatever software you are using ensure it is ready to send MIDI commands.

3: Start musicbridge. Ensure it says "Active. Engine is running."

4: Set your application to send MIDI to "Virtual musicbridge Input".

5: `CMD`+`,` and click "MIDI".

6: Learn both your MIDI commands.

7: Click "General"

8: Configure your fadetime (in seconds)

9: Set your player

10: Have fun!
